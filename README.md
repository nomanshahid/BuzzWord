# BuzzWord
BuzzWord is an Android application that creates alphanumeric equivalents of any given phone number. This allows the user to discover any hidden words in their number based on keypad mappings. 

For example: *456-789-2899* is equivalent to *456-789-**BUZZ***

BuzzWord uses Square's OkHttp client to retrieve data from Pearson's Dictionary API. The application was made to explore the concepts of multithreading and concurrency. It provides a stable user experience through asynchronous processing even when network issues arise.
